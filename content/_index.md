Hey! My name is Zach and I am a fourth year Mathematics PhD student at the University of Iowa. My interests in many areas of math including commutative algebra, combinatorics, and knot theory. I am currently working with my advisor, Prof. Isabel Darcy, to complete a database of 2- string tangles with at most 10 crossings (think KnotInfo).
