      <description>I was introduced to Keith Conrad when taking my first course in Abstract Algebra. His expository papers in Group and Ring theory were incredibly useful to me, and beyond that I was able to investigate so much more beyond course content in a digestible way. If you have not had the pleasure of perusing his expository papers, I encourage you to do so (they are all posted here )!</description>
